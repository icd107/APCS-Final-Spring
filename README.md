# Cat Simulator I
This is my AP Computer Science project for the Spring of 2017.

Do you think you have what it takes to be a crazy cat lady and take care of a bunch of cats? Well, now you can find out.
This game will give you a cat, one you have to use energy to take care of, while also balancing your energy with working to make money to buy things for you cats. While it starts easy with excess energy, as you adopt more and more cats, your energy will have to be spread out thinly.
Unfortunately, your cats can die, so be sure to take care of them and utilize your energy efficiently!

Because this project was created for a class, some areas of the code are inefficient to meet certain requirements.
